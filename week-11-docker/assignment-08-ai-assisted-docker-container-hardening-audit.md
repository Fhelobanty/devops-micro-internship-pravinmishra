# Assignment 8 — AI-Assisted Docker Container Hardening Audit

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash script that audits a running Docker container for common hardening gaps — running as root, missing health checks, unpinned image tags, privileged mode, and unnecessary exposed ports — then connect that script to Claude Code as a reusable `/docker-audit` skill. You will run the audit against your production-grade EpicBook stack, fix what it finds by editing the Dockerfile yourself, rebuild the image, and re-run the audit to prove the fix worked. Claude analyzes evidence and recommends a fix; it never edits your Dockerfile or rebuilds the image itself.

# Target Container

**Target Container Name:** `Add the exact container name here`

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Audit Workspace

## Goal

Create an audit workspace and confirm that the supplied files are available.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Audit Workspace Files

Add a terminal screenshot showing your full name and both supplied files:

```text
docker-audit.sh
SKILL.md
```

# Task 2 — Add the Docker Audit Skill to Claude Code

## Goal

Add the supplied `docker-audit` skill to Claude Code and confirm that it is available.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Docker Audit Skill Available in Claude Code

Add a screenshot of Claude Code showing `docker-audit` in the available skill list.

# Task 3 — Validate the Audit Script

## Goal

Verify the audit script line endings, Bash syntax, and usage message.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Script Validation

Add a terminal screenshot showing:

- LF line-ending check
- Successful `bash -n docker-audit.sh` validation
- Your full name
- The usage message displayed when the script runs without a container name

# Task 4 — Run the Initial Docker Security Audit

## Goal

Audit a running container and record the initial findings.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Selected Target Container

Add a terminal screenshot showing:

- Your full name
- `docker ps`
- The audit command using the selected target container name

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Initial Audit Results

Add a terminal screenshot showing the initial Docker audit results.

---

# Task 5 — Use AI Assistance to Understand the Findings

## Goal

Use the supplied `docker-audit` skill to understand the initial audit results safely.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Audit Explanation and Recommended Fix

Add a Claude Code screenshot showing:

- Audit finding
- Security risk
- Recommended manual fix
- Verification method

# Task 6 — Apply One Container-Hardening Fix

## Goal

Manually fix one WARN or FAIL finding from the initial audit.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Hardening Configuration Change

Add a screenshot of the updated Dockerfile or `docker-compose.yml` showing the selected hardening fix.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Updated Service Running

Add a terminal screenshot showing your full name and the rebuilt or recreated service/container running successfully.

---

# Task 7 — Re-Run the Audit and Compare Results

## Goal

Verify that the selected hardening fix improved the container configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Final Audit Results

Add a terminal screenshot showing:

- Your full name
- The updated running container
- The final audit report

### Before-and-After Comparison

Write a short comparison covering:

- Initial audit finding
- Dockerfile or Docker Compose change applied
- Final audit result
- Security benefit of the improvement

1. Initial audit finding: The initial audit identified that the Nginx reverse-proxy container needed hardening, particularly by running Nginx as a non-root user and improving container logging.

2. Dockerfile or Docker Compose change applied: The Dockerfile was changed to use nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.28-alpine and expose port 8080. The Docker Compose configuration was updated to publish host port 80 to container port 8080 and remove the Nginx log directory bind mount that caused permission errors.

3. Final audit result: The reverse-proxy container is running and healthy as user 101, privileged mode is disabled, the website returns HTTP 200, and Docker Compose configuration validation passes.

4. Security benefit: Running Nginx as a non-root user reduces the potential impact of a container compromise. Disabling privileged mode avoids unnecessary elevated host access, while successful health checks and HTTP tests confirm that the application remains available after the changes.

# LinkedIn Requirement

## Goal

Create a LinkedIn post about the container security checks you performed, one hardening improvement you applied, and why the improvement matters.

### Evidence

**LinkedIn Post URL:** `https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aamicheal_devops-docker-containersecurity-ugcPost-7519439205597421569-OWY6/?highlightedUpdateUrn=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7519439208852250624&highlightedUpdateType=SOCIAL_SHARE&origin=SOCIAL_SHARE&utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAADFvgDYBsnsyE66xAyq2HzH3Jfsf19WE6JA`

#### LinkedIn Post Screenshot

Add a screenshot of the published LinkedIn post, including the final audit result.
